Hi, I was analyzing the codebase to see how a specified function works and I came across a potential code smell that is reported on the following paper:
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3522664.3528620

The paper describes the code smell as follows:

Smell Name: $smell_name$.

Description : $smell_description$



https://github.com/$github_repo$/blob/$master$$filepath$#L$line_start$-L$line_end$

I have noticed also similar situations in other files, such as:

$other_files_list$

I was wondering about the definition of this code smell and I would like to ask you:

    1. Do you think this could potentially be a problem?
    2. How problematic do you consider this issue to be?
    3. Do you believe it's feasible to address this issue? If so, how would you suggest we go about fixing it?

Could you help me?

Thank you in advance!
