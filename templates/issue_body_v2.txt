Hi everyone,

I am CodeSmile!
A bot that performs automatic static analysis and analyze AI-Specific Code smell on AI projects.

During the analysis, I detected a potential issue - this happened to be one of the code smells described in the following paper:

https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3522664.3528620

The paper describes the code smell as follows:

Smell Name: $smell_name$.

Description : $smell_description$

Problem : $smell_problem$

Solution : $smell_solution$

Impact : $smell_impact$

https://github.com/$github_repo$/blob/$master$$filepath$#L$line_start$-L$line_end$

I detected other instances of the same smell in other files, like:

$other_files_list$

I hope this helps!
