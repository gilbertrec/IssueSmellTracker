Hello! 

I found an AI-Specific Code smell in your project.
The smell is called: $smell_name$

You can find more information about it in this paper: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3522664.3528620.

According to the paper, the smell is described as follows:

| **Problem**  | $smell_problem$ |
| ------------- | :------------- |
| **Solution**  | **$smell_solution$**  |
| **Impact** | **$smell_impact$**  |

Example:
 ```diff
### Pandas Column Selection
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
+ df = df[['col1', 'col2', 'col3']]

### Pandas Set DataType
import pandas as pd
- df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
+ df = pd.read_csv('data.csv', dtype={'col1': 'str', 'col2': 'int', 'col3': 'float'})
  ```
You can find the code related to this smell in this link: https://github.com/$github_repo$/blob/$master$$filepath$#L$line_start$-L$line_end$. 

I also found instances of this smell in other files, such as:

$other_files_list$.
